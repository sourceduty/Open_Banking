Leading solutions include Plaid and Yodlee, which offer APIs for account aggregation, balance checking, and transaction data across multiple banks, enabling a consistent user experience. The UK Open Banking Implementation Entity (OBIE) has developed widely adopted APIs based on regulatory requirements under the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2), which include Account Information Service (AIS) and Payment Initiation Service (PIS) APIs. These APIs are known for their adherence to security protocols like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, ensuring user authentication and consent management. Frollo and TrueLayer are other prominent platforms, each supporting compliance and connectivity in regions such as Australia and Europe. Open-source options, like the Berlin Group’s NextGenPSD2 API framework, also offer standardized APIs that banks can implement to provide secure, regulated access to customer data. These APIs are integral in building a robust ecosystem of financial products that can interoperate across institutions, creating new opportunities for innovation in the financial sector.
